Not much to say here, I just thought it could be interesting to upload my solutions for this year's Advent Of Code.

I've never done this kind of challenge before (nor have I sent stuff publicly on here) so I guess I'm gonna do a whole lot of things wrong but why not try and do it anyway.

This repo will just contain my code, in the same state it's in when I work on it for the challenge. I have no plan to add anything beyond that.
